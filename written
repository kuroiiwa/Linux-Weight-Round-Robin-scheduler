1. test/gen_cpu_proc.c test/gen_io_proc.c

 gen_cpu_proc.c can fork 5 children for cpu bound.
 gen_io_proc.c can fork 5 children wait for input.

 Run gen_io_proc first, because it won't affect the performance of
 computer.
 Then run gen_cpu_proc, it will print some information about wrr_info,
 this process will exit in several minites, it depends on your computer.

 What you will see is all the cpu bound and io bound process can run
 cocurrently.

 If you change the CHILD_PROC to a large number e.g. 100, you can check
 the log of gen_cpu_proc.c to see the load balancing is worked. processes
 running on each CPU should be roughly the same.
